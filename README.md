# Usage Vacuum 

Usage Vacuum takes a Python script built to demo some functionality with print output, converts it to markdown.
The markdown contains the demo code interspersed with print output.

This works well with my process:
* As I develop functionality, I write tests, but I also write a demo usage script.
* The demo usage script looks like a walk through of what my new code does.
* So converting it into interesting markdown makes sense to me.

Essentially: input is a demo python script for functionality
output is markdown showing how the code produces output, created from the code itself.

Saves time if you are producing walkthrough markdown and have a script.

Another benefit is that you can test your demo usage script, then convert it to markdown when it works.
This prevents beautiful markdown with scripting in it which does not work or does not produce the advertised output.

## Repo checklist

Repo checklist:

* [ ] Run foundation.py with the destination project folder as a command line argument.
    * This will copy all important files to your project, renaming at least one for your repo.
    * Don't worry.  It won't overwrite existing files with the same names there.
* [ ] Add your favorite [git aliases](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases) to .git/config.
    * Don't have favorites?  Try out the aliases from [Ned Batchelder's](https://github.com/nedbat) [dot repo](https://github.com/nedbat/dot), extracted into [this file](https://github.com/ErikPohl444/resources/blob/main/git_aliases.txt). 
* [ ] Complete a starter [.gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#:~:text=A%20gitignore%20file%20specifies%20intentionally,gitignore%20file%20specifies%20a%20pattern.)
    * [ ] Keep the current starter .gitignore and add to it.
    * [ ] OR delete the starter I'm providing and either create one via template in GitHub by typing in the name .gitignore in the file name after choosing to create a file
    * [ ] OR create one [using this tool.](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/)
* [ ] Populate AUTHORS.md with the authors of the work in the repo. 
    * Foundation will populate the first commit author if it can find a git repo and at least one commit.
    * Refer to [these instructions](https://opensource.google/documentation/reference/releasing/authors) for other ways to create and maintain this reference. 
* [ ] Add a [sponsor button](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/displaying-a-sponsor-button-in-your-repository), if you intend to solicit funding for the work in your repo.
* [ ] Add a [social media image](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/customizing-your-repositorys-social-media-preview), if you'd like your repo to have a specific image when referenced in social media.
* [ ] Add [topics](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics) to your repo to help the repo be searchable and comprehensible.
* [ ] Enter any acknowledgements into ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md to acknowledge inspirations, code you've used, and people who helped you in your journey to this repo.
* [ ] Accept a license to define how people can legally use, share, etc. your repo:
    * The default license provided by this process is the [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).  **This is automated in Foundation, but it needs to see a git repo with a commit to change this.**
    * If you don't want that one, delete it from your repo and use GitHub to [select one easily](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository).
* [ ] Accept a code of conduct to indicate how members of the community around your repo should interact:
    * Delete the current CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md if you don't want the recommended code of conduct for small projects, as currently available from GitHub.
    * If you prefer another code of conduct, you can make your own or use GitHub's [easy instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project).
* [ ] Accept a CODEOWNERS file to enforce who the code owners are.
    * Blank is fine to start out with.
    * Use [these instruction](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners) from Github if you'd like to develop CODEOWNERS more.
* [ ] Modify CONTRIBUTING.md, if you want [instructions for contributing to your repo](https://contributing.md/how-to-build-contributing-md/).
    * More detail can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors).
* [ ] Add a [CITATIONS.cff file](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-citation-files) if you'd like to specify how others cite your work.
* [ ] Update README.md to pull all of the above together, along with other items important to understanding your repo.
* [ ] If you need a Makefile for builds, [make one](https://makefiletutorial.com/)
* [ ] If you need a Manifest, [manifest one](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/sharing-github-apps/registering-a-github-app-from-a-manifest).
* [ ] Consider releasing a [release plan](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository).
* [ ] Do you need/want a config file in json, yaml, or .ini?
* [ ] Incorporate a [CI/CD pipeline](https://github.com/resources/articles/devops/ci-cd):
    * [ ] Create GitHub Actions [for your repo](https://github.com/features/actions).
        * Other tools like [Travis](https://www.travis-ci.com/) and [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/solutions/pipeline/) and [Azure DevOps Pipelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/what-is-azure-pipelines?view=azure-devops) are available.    
    * [ ] Create [Git hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/ms/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks), if you'd like.
        * I recommend [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).
        * [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) is also available.
    * [ ] Confirm the following items are captured using Sonarqube or other static analysis tools and that you have a minimum tolerance for each metric which is tested against:
        * Code Complexity:
            * Cognitive complexity
            * Cyclomatic code complexity
        * Duplications
        * Maintainability
        * Issues metrics
        * Reliability
        * Size
        * Test Coverage
        * Passing and failing test metrics
        * Security    
* [ ] Containerize the code for distribtion, if you'd like.
    * Add, for example, a Dockerfile or compose.yaml, if using Docker.   
* [ ] This is a parent checkbox for all Python-specific items:
  * [ ] Populate [requirements.txt](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/) and keep it populated through pip freeze > requirements.txt
  * [ ] Confirm tests are in /tests.
      * Leverage [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) or another fully-modernized test framework for testing.
      * Leverage [coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/7.6.10/) or a similar tool for code coverage analysis.
  * [ ] Confirm source code is in /src
  * [ ] Confirm docs are in /docs
  * [ ] There is a very primitive [setup_logging.py](https://github.com/ErikPohl444/resources/blob/main/src/setup_logging.py) file included here to import for [logging purposes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html).  Delete it, make your own, etc.  
  * [ ] If you'd like eventually to make a Python package, there's a starter [pyproject.toml](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/#configuring-metadata) you can edit, or you can delete this file.
    * Because this resources utility is Python build tool agnostic, I am not including a setup.py for setuptools, or any other files or configurations specific to Hatchling, Poetry, setuptools, Flit, or PDM.
    * More in-depth pyproject.toml information [here](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/).
        
## Important disclaimer

If any disclaimer exists, add it here.

## Getting Started

To get started with Usage Vacuum, prepare a Python script that demonstrates the functionality you want to showcase. This script should include print statements to display outputs as you walk through your code. Once your demo script is ready and working as intended, you can use Usage Vacuum to convert it into a markdown file, where the code and its outputs are interleaved for easy sharing and documentation.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or newer must be installed on your system.
- Ensure you have `pip` (Python package manager) available.
- It is recommended to use a virtual environment (such as `venv` or `virtualenv`) to manage dependencies.
- Your demo script should be a standalone Python file that runs without errors.

## Installing

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ErikPohl444/usage_vacuum.git
   cd usage_vacuum
   ```
2. (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   If a `requirements.txt` is not yet provided, install any needed libraries as you encounter ImportErrors, or create one with your environment’s current packages using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.
